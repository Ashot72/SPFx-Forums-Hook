I built a React Hooks based SharePoint SPFx forum. Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. You have 90% cleaner code with Hooks. The app uses Reactâ€˜s built-in hooks, our custom and third-party hooks and shows how to use code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense.

You can download the package from here and upload it to your Tenant App Catalog to run the forum.

To get started.
```
       Clone the repository

       git https://github.com/ashotik/SPFx-forums-hooks
       cd SPFx-forums-hooks

       # installs dependencies
       npm install

       # creates release package which should be deployed in SharePoint app catalog
        npm run deploy-prod
      
```
